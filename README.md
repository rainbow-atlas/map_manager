# Rainbow Atlas Map Manager

A web application for managing and visualizing location data with Google Maps integration.

## Local Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following structure:
   ```env
   # Google Sheets Configuration
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   VITE_GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour Private Key Here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
   VITE_GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=your-private-key-id
   VITE_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-google-sheet-id

   # Users Configuration
   VITE_USERS_CONFIG='{
     "admin": {
       "password": "your-admin-password",
       "role": "admin"
     },
     "editor": {
       "password": "your-editor-password",
       "role": "editor"
     },
     "viewer": {
       "password": "your-viewer-password",
       "role": "viewer"
     },
     "guest": {
       "password": "your-guest-password",
       "role": "guest"
     }
   }'
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Managing GitHub Secrets

The application requires several environment variables to be set as GitHub Secrets for deployment. To set these up:

1. Install GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew install gh
   ```

2. Login to GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Run the secrets setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/set-github-secrets.sh
   ```

This script will:
- Read your local `.env` file
- Set each environment variable as a GitHub Secret
- Make the secrets available to your GitHub Pages deployment

Note: For GitHub Pages deployment, you need to set these secrets in your repository's settings:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Add the following secrets:
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
   - `VITE_GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY`
